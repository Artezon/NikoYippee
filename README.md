I tried to make a fun little app with Niko, who is not a cat btw, meowing in different programming languages.

Each version has their pros and cons. All of them compile into a single executable file.
- **NikoTheCompanion** - written in C# with AvaloniaUI and NAudio. The only one version where I could implement sprite changing when audio starts and stops playing. Also it has modern Acrylic effect. But in works only on Windows... Anyway this one is really cool. Yippee!!
- **NikoMeow** - written in Go with Fyne and Beep libraries. I don't have much to say about it. Plays random meow sound :3
- **niko_app** - written in Rust with Slint and Rodio. Has the lowest exe file size. Also has random pitch change :D

I wanted to add other characters like world machine, hello penguin and ram but I'm too lazy >_<

Compiled executables for Windows can be found in the release section.
